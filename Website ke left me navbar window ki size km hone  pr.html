                <p>
                    The first mouse was invented in 1964 by Douglas Engelbart, a computer scientist at the Stanford
                    Research
                    Institute. Engelbart's mouse was a wooden box with two wheels on the bottom and two buttons on top.
                    It
                    was connected to a computer by a wire.
        
                    The mouse was not widely adopted until the early 1980s when Apple Computer introduced the Macintosh
                    computer with a mouse as its standard input device. The Macintosh was the first computer to use a
                    GUI,
                    and the mouse was essential for navigation.
        
                    There are two main types of mice: wired and wireless. Wired mice are connected to the computer by a
                    cable, while wireless mice use radio waves to communicate with the computer.
        
                    Wired mice are more reliable than wireless mice, but they can be more difficult to use with laptops
                    and
                    other portable devices. Wireless mice are more convenient than wired mice. But they can be more
                    expensive, and they may have a shorter battery life.
        
                    There are also a variety of other types of mice, including the following:

                <img src="https://javatpoint-images.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/computer/images/what-is-a-joystick4.jpg">
                <p>
                    What are the different types of joysticks?
                    There are various types of joysticks available, including analog joysticks, digital joysticks,
                    flight
                    sticks, and gamepad-style joysticks. Analog joysticks provide a smooth range of motion, while
                    digital
                    joysticks have predefined directions. Flight sticks are specifically designed for flight simulators,
                    and
                    gamepad-style joysticks resemble traditional game controllers with added joystick functionality.
        
                    How are joysticks used in gaming?
                    In gaming, joysticks are used to control the movement of characters or vehicles within a game. They
                    enable you to navigate through virtual environments, aim weapons, perform complex maneuvers, and
                    interact with objects in the game world. Joysticks are popular in-flight simulators, racing games,
                    and
                    other genres that require precise control.
        
                    Can joysticks be used with consoles and personal computers (PCs)
                    Yes, joysticks can be used with both consoles and PCs. Most modern gaming consoles, such as
                    PlayStation
                    and Xbox, have universal service bus (USB) ports that allow you to connect to a joystick directly.

                <h1>Scanner</h1>
                <p>
                    How does a scanner work?
                    Scanners work by using a light source and a photosensitive sensor to capture the content of a
                    document
                    or image. 
                    <br/>
                    <img src="https://javatpoint-images.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/computer/images/what-is-scanner1.jpg"> 
                    <br/>When you place the document on the scanning bed and initiate the scan, the light source
                    illuminates the document, and the sensor captures the reflected light. The sensor then converts the
                    light patterns into digital information, creating a digital representation of the scanned content.
        
                    What types of scanners are there?
                    There are various types of scanners available, each designed for specific purposes. The most common
                    types include flatbed scanners, sheet-fed scanners, portable scanners, and three-dimensional (3D)
                    scanners. Flatbed scanners have a flat glass bed where you place the document or image, while
                    sheet-fed
                    scanners are designed to handle multiple documents in a stack. Portable scanners are compact and can
                    be
                    easily carried around, and 3D scanners are used to create digital models of three-dimensional
                    objects.
        
                    What are the advantages of using a scanner?
                    Using a scanner offers several advantages. First, it allows you to create digital copies of
                    important
                    documents, preserving them in a more secure and easily accessible format. Scanning also enables you
                    to
                    share documents electronically, reducing the need for physical copies and the associated costs.
                    Additionally, scanners make it possible to edit and enhance scanned images, improving their quality
                    and
                    making them more versatile.

                <h1>Monitor</h1>
                <p>The monitor is an output device that displays the output in
                     the form of images on a digital screen. The images formed
                     are made up of millions of tiny dots called pixels. The 
                     more pixels, the better resolution of the image is.</p>

                <p>Earlier monitors had screens made of CRT, but are now replaced
                     by flat panel displays. Let us understand how both are
                      different from each other-
                    <br/><br/>
                   <strong style="color: blue;">CRT</strong>– The CRT 
                   or cathode ray tube is the structure behind the screen. 
                   That helps to display characters and images on the monitor. 
                   the display side consists of a phosphorescent screen. 
                   The screen lights up when a beam of electrons hits the 
                   screen from the cathode filament. The electrons are deflected
                    and accelerated and that is how the images are formed on the 
                    screen.</p>

                   <p>Printers are another peripheral device used as output devices.
                        The output from the computer is achieved on paper from the 
                        printer. The data gets printed on paper which can be both 
                        colored or black and white, an image, text, or even both.
        
                       The printer can be majorly divided into two types-
                       <br/>
                       Impact printers – These printers work by having direct 
                       contact with the ink ribbon and paper. Due to this, the noise
                        produced by these printers resembles that of a typewriter.<br/>
                       Non-Impact printers – These printers work with technologies
                        like inkjet, laser, electrostatic, xerographic, etc. These 
                        printers work silently and are much faster than the impact 
                        ones.</p>
